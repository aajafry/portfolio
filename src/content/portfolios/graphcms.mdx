**GraphCMS** is a blog application inspired by Medium, designed to explore the integration of GraphQL with the front end. The backend is powered by Hygraph, a headless CMS, while the frontend is built using Next.js. This setup leverages GraphQL for efficient data querying and management, resulting in a seamless and dynamic content creation and display experience.
